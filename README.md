# OTF_Frontend_Task

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.3.2.

## Previous configurations

First of all, you need to go to `https://github.com/Santiago26009/OTF_Backend_Task` repository and use git clone to download the project. Look at the README file and follow the instructions to run the backend server. Notice that the backend needs to be running first so you can see the users and perform the CRUD actions.

## Development server
1. Run `npm i` to install node modules folder.
2. Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
3. If you already started the backend, you will see the CRUD table with the existing users in the Hub DB.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
